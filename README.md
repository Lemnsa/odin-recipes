#### WHAT I LEARNED BUILDING THIS PROJECT
## List 
In this project the two main types of lists, ordered <ol></ol> and unordered list<ul></ul> are implemented.
The list items are placed in <li>content here</li>

## Page linking
Web pages are linked, the homepage in the parent directory is linked to other webpages
in the child directory using <a href="./child directory/page name.html">.

## Adding of images to the page
This was done by grouping the images in the image directory and within each recipe page 
the images were link with <img src="image location" alt="descriptive text">

## Git implementation
Most commonly used git commands like:
    git add : to save changes of the project files
    git commit -m: to give a subject and the reason of the changes made
    git push: to finally upload the completed project

## Adding a README 
This important because it highlights new skill gems that were learned in
the project development, from start to finish.

### A big shout out to The Odin Community for the learning Materials.
